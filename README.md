##  How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have a  C compiler (like GCC) installed. You can compile any program using:


gcc program_name.c -o output
./output


Example:


gcc factorial.c -o factorial
./factorial

### You can also use an IDE like Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or Visual Studio Code with a C extension.
